## Context Rule
[cite_start]Always read the `docs/` folder before starting any task to understand current state and technical constraints[cite: 53].

## Self-Reflect Rule
[cite_start]Before writing code, state your hypothesis and identify potential side effects (especially regarding Google Sheets API limits and race conditions)[cite: 52].

## Minimalism Rule
Focus on high-impact, clean changes. [cite_start]Do not create new files unless strictly necessary[cite: 54].

## Technical Source of Truth
[cite_start]Refer to `docs/TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` for math formulas and database logic[cite: 47].
